#### ANSIBLE REFACTORING AND STATIC ASSIGNMENTS (IMPORTS AND ROLES)

In this project I will continue working with [ansible-config-mgt](https://github.com/hectorproko/ansible-config-mgt.git) repository and make some improvements to the code. Now I need to refactor the **Ansible** code, create assignments, and learn how to use the **imports** functionality to effectively re-use previously created playbooks in a new playbook – it allows us to organize tasks and reuse them as needed.

So far in Projects 9 & 11 every **new** change in the code creates a separate directory which is not very convenient when we want to run some commands from one place so we'll use plug in [Copy Artifact](https://plugins.jenkins.io/copyartifact/)

Creating directory in **Jenkins** instance to store all artifacts after each build
``` bash
sudo mkdir /home/ubuntu/ansible-config-artifact
```

Changing permission of the directory `ansible-config-artifact`
``` bash
ubuntu@ip-172-31-94-159:~$ sudo chmod -R 0777 /home/ubuntu/ansible-config-artifact	
ubuntu@ip-172-31-94-159:~$ ls -l

Creating **Jenkins** Job **save_artifacts**

![Markdown Logo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hectorproko/ANSIBLE-REFACTORING-ASSIGNMENTS-IMPORTS/main/images/itemName.png)


This project/job will be triggered by completion of our existing **ansible** project.   
![Markdown Logo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hectorproko/ANSIBLE-REFACTORING-ASSIGNMENTS-IMPORTS/main/images/copy_artifact_trigger.png)


Now we configure the job to actually save the artifact to the directory we just created  `/home/ubuntu/ansible-config-artifact`

I will test the job by making a change in repo `ansible-config-mgt` specifically the readme file to trigger the project through the webhook

Shows it was triggered by a **push** *(a commit with message "Update README.md")* and it triggered job **save_artifacts**

Finished: SUCCESS
```

Looking at `save_artifacts`'s **Console Output** we see it was triggered by upstream project `ansible`

![Markdown Logo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hectorproko/ANSIBLE-REFACTORING-ASSIGNMENTS-IMPORTS/main/images/consoleOutput.png)

``` bash
Started by upstream project "ansible" build number 10	
originally caused by:
 Started by GitHub push by hectorproko
Running as SYSTEM
Building in workspace /var/lib/jenkins/workspace/save_artifacts
Copied 7 artifacts from "ansible" build number 10
Finished: SUCCESS
```

Now the directory we created is populated 
``` bash
ubuntu@ip-172-31-94-159:~/ansible-config-artifact$ sudo tree
.
├── 2plays.yml
├── README.md
├── inventory [error opening dir] #tree didnt work
└── playbooks [error opening dir]
2 directories, 2 files
```

Just to see my pipeline worked I created **TestFile** in the repo `ansible-config-mng` to trigger the `ansible` job automatically and I can see the file in the directory `ansible-config-artifact`

``` bash
ubuntu@ip-172-31-94-159:~/ansible-config-artifact$ sudo tree
.
├── 2plays.yml
├── README.md
├── TestFile #<<<
├── inventory [error opening dir]
└── playbooks [error opening dir]

2 directories, 3 files
```

As I add/move/delete files in the repo and change the structure, I can see it copied to `ansible-config-artifact`

#### REFACTOR ANSIBLE CODE BY IMPORTING OTHER PLAYBOOKS INTO SITE.YML  

I will now move away from having all my tasks in a single playbook like I did in [Project 11](https://github.com/hectorproko/ANSIBLE-AUTOMATE/blob/main/Steps_Project11.md) with `common.yml`. Breaking tasks up into different files is an excellent way to organize complex sets of tasks and reuse them.

1. Within playbooks folder I will create `site.yml` – This file will now be considered as an entry point into the entire infrastructure configuration. By including other playbooks in it, `site.yml` becomes the parent to all other playbooks that will be developed.

2. At the root of the repository I create a folder `static-assignments` where I will store all other children playbooks
   
3. I'll move `common.yml` file into the newly created `static-assignments` folder.
 
4. Inside `site.yml` file I'll import `common.yml` playbook.

``` bash
import_playbook: ../static-assignments/common.yml
```
In addition, I created another playbook `common-del.yml` which is just a copy of `common.yml` with **state** set to **absent** to undo changes *(uninstall wireshark)*  

 So far my `ansible-config-artifact` directory structure looks like this  
 
``` bash
ubuntu@ip-172-31-94-159:~/ansible-config-artifact$ sudo tree
.
├── 2plays.yml
├── README.md
├── inventory #Will start using static inventories
│   ├── dev.yml
│   ├── prod.yml
│   ├── staging
│   └── uat
├── playbooks
│   └── site.yml
└── static-assignments
    ├── common-del.yml
    └── common.yml
```


#### CONFIGURE UAT WEBSERVERS WITH A ROLE ‘WEBSERVER’  

Created 2 new instances with **RedHat**  
**Web1-UAT**  
**Web2-UAT**  

To create a role, I'll create a directory called `roles`, relative to the playbook.

Inside repo `ansible-config-mgt` I create a directory `roles`
and used utility **ansible-galaxy** to create the a structure which I named **webservers** *(I commit and push to Hithub)*

``` bash
mkdir roles
cd roles
ansible-galaxy init webserver
```
``` bash
hector@hector-Laptop:~/ansible-config-mgt/roles$ tree
.
└── webserver
    ├── defaults
    │   └── main.yml
    ├── files
    ├── handlers
    │   └── main.yml
    ├── meta
    │   └── main.yml
    ├── README.md
    ├── tasks
    │   └── main.yml
    ├── templates
    ├── tests
    │   ├── inventory
    │   └── test.yml
    └── vars
        └── main.yml
```
*This default structure might have extra directories we won't use and can delete*  

Need to make an entry on **ansible** configuration file `/etc/ansible/ansible.cfg` specifying the location of the roles `/home/ubuntu/ansible-config-mgt/roles`

``` bash
roles_path = /home/ubuntu/ansible-config-mgt/roles
```

#### REFERENCE WEBSERVER ROLE  

Within the `static-assignments` folder I create a new assignment/**playbook** for **uat-webservers** `uat-webservers.yml` which contains a reference to the role we just created **webservers**

``` bash
---
- hosts: uat-webservers #From static inventory uat.ini
  remote_user: ec2-user
  roles:
    - webservers
```
I will be using inventory file `ansible-config-mgt/inventory/uat.ini`  
``` bash
[uat-webservers]
172.31.81.182 ansible_ssh_user='ec2-user'
172.31.89.227 ansible_ssh_user='ec2-user'
```
I test it  
`ansible-inventory -i ansible-config-artifact/inventory/uat.ini --graph`

``` bash
@all:
  |--@uat-webservers:
  |  |--172.31.81.182
  |  |--172.31.89.227
  |--@ungrouped:
```

Now I have to import this **playbook** in our **parent playbook** `site.yml`
``` bash
- import_playbook: ../static-assignments/uat-webservers.yml
```

Finally I can run the **playbook** against my uat inventory and see what happens:  
``` bash
sudo ansible-playbook -i /home/ubuntu/ansible-config-mgt/inventory/uat.yml /home/ubuntu/ansible-config-mgt/playbooks/site.yaml
```
